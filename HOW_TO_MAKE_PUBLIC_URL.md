# How to Create a Public URL for Heaven Pages

## ✅ The URL is Already Public!

**`https://dashmemories.com/heaven/kobe-bryant`** is already publicly accessible.

### Why it's public:
- Next.js pages are public by default
- No authentication required
- No login needed
- Anyone can visit the URL directly

## 📋 To Share the Link:

Just copy and share this URL:
```
https://dashmemories.com/heaven/kobe-bryant
```

That's it! No special setup needed.

## 🔧 Current Status:

- ✅ URL is public and accessible
- ✅ Route exists: `/heaven/[name].tsx`
- ⚠️ Page needs to finish loading (we're fixing this)

## 💡 How It Works:

1. User visits: `https://dashmemories.com/heaven/kobe-bryant`
2. Next.js serves the page from `src/pages/heaven/[name].tsx`
3. Page extracts "kobe-bryant" from the URL
4. Page loads the video from Mux
5. Video plays automatically

## 🎯 Once Working:

The link will be:
- ✅ Shareable via text, email, QR code
- ✅ Works on any device
- ✅ No login required
- ✅ Publicly accessible

## 📱 Share Options:

- **Copy URL**: `https://dashmemories.com/heaven/kobe-bryant`
- **QR Code**: Generate QR code pointing to this URL
- **Embed**: Can embed iframe if needed
- **Direct link**: Works in browser, social media, etc.

**The URL is ready - we just need to fix the loading issue so the video actually shows!**
