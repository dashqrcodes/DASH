## 🧪 How to Test (Even with Production Only)

### Option 1: Test on Production (Simplest)
- Just visit your production URLs after deploying
- See if videos work
- If not, fix and redeploy

### Option 2: Test Locally First (Optional)
- Create `.env.local` file in project root
- Add the same variables
- Run `npm run dev`
- Test on `localhost:3000`
- Deploy when ready

**You don't need Preview deployments - you can test directly on production since no users yet!**
