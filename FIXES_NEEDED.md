# 🔧 Card Builder Fixes Needed

## Issues to Fix:
1. ❌ Remove rounded corners on card preview
2. ❌ Overlay form fields ON TOP of card (Canva-style editing)
3. ❌ Remove duplicate font selector (only needs ONE)

## Current Problems:
- Cards have `border-radius: 12px` → Should be `0`
- Font selector appears TWICE in HTML
- Input fields are SEPARATE from preview → Should be OVERLAID

## User Request:
"Make corners square, overlay editing over the card like Canva"

Working on these fixes now...

## Additional Fixes:
4. ❌ Photo upload button should be CENTER of front card
5. ❌ Button should be nice round "+" button
6. ❌ File picker opens INSTANTLY on tap (no delay)

## Design Goal:
- Beautiful big round + button in center
- Tap → file picker opens immediately
- Photo appears instantly in card
