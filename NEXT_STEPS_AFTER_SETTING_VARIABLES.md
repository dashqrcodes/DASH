# ✅ Next Steps - You're Almost Done!

## 🎯 What to Do Now

You've set up the environment variables. Here's what's next:

## ✅ Step 1: Redeploy (REQUIRED!)

2. Find your **latest deployment** (top of list)
3. Click **"⋯"** (three dots) on the right
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for it to complete
6. Status should show **"Ready"** ✅

**Do this NOW - variables don't work until redeployed!**

## ✅ Step 2: Test Your Videos

**After deployment completes:**

1. Visit: `https://dashmemories.com/heaven/kobe-bryant`
