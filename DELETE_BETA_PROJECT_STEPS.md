## ✅ Confirmed: "beta" is a Separate Vercel Project

**Current URL:** `https://vercel.com/david-gastelums-projects/beta`

This is a **separate project** from your main `nextjs-auth-app` project, which is why it might be costing money (especially if it has premium features enabled).

## 🔍 Alternative: Check If Beta is Actually Costing Money

**Before deleting, verify it's actually costing money:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: `https://vercel.com/dashboard`
2. Click on your **account/profile** (top right)
3. Click **"Billing"** or **"Usage"**
4. Check:
   - Is "beta" project using paid features?
   - Is it over free tier limits?
   - Is it on a paid plan?

**Note:** If it's just using free tier features, it might not actually be costing money. But you can still delete it to clean up your projects.

## 💡 Alternative: Just Stop Using It

If you're not sure about deleting:

1. **Disconnect Git:**
   - Settings → Git
   - Disconnect the repository
   - This stops automatic deployments

2. **Don't deploy to it:**
   - Just stop using it
   - It won't cost money if you're not using paid features

3. **Keep it for now:**
   - Preview deployments are free
   - Only paid features cost money
